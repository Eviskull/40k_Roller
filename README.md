# 40k Dice Roller

## Purpose
This Python program was developed to make casual Warhammer 40,000 a little easier to play. When more dice than can be carried need to be rolled, it's nice to have an automated roller on hand.

I recommend using this only when the number of attacks to be rolled exceeds the number of dice that can reasonably fit in your hand. My limit is about 35.

## How it Works
Just run python3 <number_of_dice> and press enter. Output is formatted for 40k specifically, so it mainly specified how many dice reached or exceeded a given number. For example, the `5+ -- 10` means that 10 dice rolled either a 5 or a 6.
